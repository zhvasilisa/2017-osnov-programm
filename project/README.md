The task was to find the frequency of particular phonetic vowel contexts.
In the program, I call these contexts 'syllables' (although they are not syllables in the traditional sense).
There are two options: to look for all syllables that are present in the word list or to look for the syllables that the user chooses.
1. Run 'dict_entries.py' to create a list of dictionary entries entries.txt.
2. Run 'syllables_all.py' (you need 'sounds.txt' for that) or 'syllables_set.py' to create a text file with syllables and words from the word list that have these syllables 'syllables.txt' (see above the difference between them).
3. Run 'find_syllables.py' to get a table with the frequencies 'frequencies.tsv'.
